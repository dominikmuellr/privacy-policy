  <h1>Privacy Policy – Trudido</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 24.10.2025 </p>

  <p>At Trudido, your privacy matters to us. We want you to know exactly what information we handle when you use our app.</p>

  <h2>What We Collect</h2>
  <p>We don’t collect any personal information from you. That means no names, emails, contacts, location data, or device identifiers. Nothing.</p>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>Since we don’t collect anything, we don’t use your data for analytics, advertising, or anything else. The app works just as it should without ever seeing your personal information.</p>

  <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>
  <p>We do not share or sell any information—because there isn’t any to share.</p>

  <h2>Safety and Security</h2>
  <p>Even though we don’t collect personal data, we take care to maintain your safety while using the app. We follow best practices to ensure the app itself is secure.</p>

  <h2>For Children</h2>
  <p>Our app is not intended for children under 13. We don’t knowingly collect data from kids.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Currently, our app does not include any third-party analytics, ads, or trackers. If we ever add these, we will update this Privacy Policy to be transparent about it.</p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Because we don’t collect personal information, there’s no data to access, modify, or delete.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>If anything changes, like new features or third-party services, we’ll update this Privacy Policy in the app and at <a href="https://github.com/dominikmuellr/privacy-policy"></a>.</p>

  <h2>Questions?</h2>
  <p>You can reach us anytime at <a href="mailto:dmuellr.dev@gmail.com"></a>.</p>
